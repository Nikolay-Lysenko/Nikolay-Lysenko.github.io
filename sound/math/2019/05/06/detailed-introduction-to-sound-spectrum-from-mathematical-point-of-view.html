<h3 id="time-based-reprepsentation-of-sound">Time-Based Reprepsentation of Sound</h3>

<p>A sound fragment can be represented as a univariate function of time $f: T \to \mathbb{R}$, where the set $T$ is a set of moments of time for which this fragment relates. For example, it can be a continuous interval $[t_\mathrm{start}, t_\mathrm{end}]$. If we are talking about digital sound, $T$ is a discrete sequence with a step defined by frame rate (frame rate of 44100 samples per second is often used now). However, further in this article, $T$ is supposed to be $\mathbb{R}$ (the whole time axis) for the sake of convenience.</p>

<p>Let us shed some light on physical interpretation. Take in mind that sound is heard or recorded in a particular location. So $f$ relates to this location and each value $f(t)$ also relates to the corresponding moment of time $t$. The value $f(t)$ measures deviation of pressure from average pressure in a medium. Such deviations are caused by sound waves.</p>

<p>Time-based representation of a sound can be seen in plenty of sound graphs created by audio software. The example is shown below:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/sound_graph_cluttered.png" alt="sound_graph_cluttered" /></p>

<p>The picture is cluttered, so, maybe, it does not look like a graph of univariate function. Nevetheless, if you zoom it in, you can see that this is a function:</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img src="/assets/sound_graph_zoomed.png" alt="sound_graph_zoomed" /></p>

<p>To conclude this section, let us note that function $f$ refers to a single audio channel. In stereo audio, there is a pair of functions $f_\mathrm{left}$ and $f_\mathrm{right}$, one per each of the channels.</p>

<h3 id="on-the-way-to-spectral-representation-of-sound">On the Way to Spectral Representation of Sound</h3>

<p>Time-based representation unambiguously defines sound fragment. If so, why other sound representations are needed? Actually, the reason is that time-based representation is not always convenient for analysis. For example, can you guess musical instruments from above sound graphs? Or can you guess musical style?</p>

<p>It turns out that some fundamental properties of sound are not defined in terms of $f(t)$ values, but are defined in terms of their dynamic in time.</p>

<p>To start with, look at $f(t) \equiv \mathrm{const}$. Computer-generated audio track for such sound consists of three parts: a snap in the very beginning, silence all over the time, and a final snap in the very end. Thus, non-zero values of $f(t)$ may stand for absence of sound and this is a bit of counter-intuitive.</p>

<p>To continue, think about the concept of pitch. Only periodic sounds have pitch. If $f$ has no periodic parts, pitch of the corresponding sound is undefined. For example, people can not define pitch of percussion or noise. This way of that, to analyze pitch (and timbre) one needs to decompose $f$ into periodic parts and time-based representation of $f$ is not suitable for it.</p>

<p>Arguably, the most often used periodic functions are sine and cosine, which are called trigonometric functions. It follows from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem">Weierstrass approximation theorem</a> that <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trigonometric_polynomial">trigonometric polynomials</a> are dense in the space of continuous periodic functions with period such that $2\pi$ is multiple of it. This statement may look confusing, so let us grasp it by parts.</p>

<p>A trigonometric polynomial of degree $N \in \mathbb{N}$ is a function of form:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(t) = a_0 + \sum_{n=1}^N a_n \cos(nt) + \sum_{n=1}^N b_n \sin(nt),</script>

<p>where $a_i \in \mathbb{R}$ and $b_i \in \mathbb{R}$ are coefficients of this polynomial.</p>

<p>Alternatively, it can be written in a more compact notation using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler%27s_formula">Euler’s formula</a>:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">P(t) = \sum_{n=-N}^N c_n e^{int},</script>

<p>where $c_i \in \mathbb{C}$ are coefficients of this polynomial. Their imaginary part stands for phase shift and this is explained in further sections.</p>

<p>Approximation theorem states that given a continuous periodic function $f$ and a desired precision $\varepsilon$, it is posiible to find large enough $N$ so that there exists a trigonometric polynomial $P$ that approximates $f$ with the given precision. Loosely speaking, we can assume that there exists $P$ such that $f \approx P$.</p>

<p>Rigorous formulations and proofs are beyond scope of the article. Here, it is only appropriate to highlight that described approximation allows represent sound in another form. Suppose that an approximation of sound function $f$ is a trigonometric polynomial $P$ of known degree $N$. Then the sound can be represented as a $(2N+1)$-element vector whose components are coefficients of $P$. Similarly to time-based representation, such representation uniquely defines a sound (but such sound is equal to original sound only up to approximation error). Unlikely to time-based representation, such representation allows clearly seeing amplitudes of each basic frequency.</p>

<p>Remember that above approach lacks universality. It can be applied only to sound functions $f$ that are periodic with period such that $2\pi$ is multiple of it. However, there is a more powerful tool for frequency analysis and it is discussed in the next section.</p>

<h3 id="fourier-transform-and-spectrum">Fourier Transform and Spectrum</h3>

<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourier_transform">Fourier transform</a> is a go-to tool for frequency and spectrum analysis. First we will define what it is and then we will see with examples how it relates to spectrum.</p>

<p>Fourier transform $\mathcal{F}$ is a function that takes a function as input and returns a new function as output:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\mathcal{F}: \{f \, \vert \, f: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}\} \to \{\hat{f} \, \vert \, \hat{f}: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{C}\}.</script>

<p>Furhter in the article, image of function $f$ under Fourier transform is denoted as $\mathcal{F}(f) = \hat{f}$.</p>

<p>All that remains is to define a way how to compute $\hat{f}$ from $f$. Exact definition depends on conventions, so you may find formulas with different constants than in this article. This way or that, define it as follows:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">\hat{f}(\xi) = \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty}f(t)e^{-i 2\pi\xi t}dt.</script>

<p>If you are not familiar with Fourier transform, this may look weird. However, examples can help to understand why Fourier transform is so useful.</p>

<p>The first example is $f(t) = A\cos(2\pi\omega t)$, where $A \in \mathbb{R}$ is amplitude of the wave and $\omega \in \mathbb{R}_{\ge 0}$ is frequency of the wave in Hz (i.e., in cycles per second).</p>

<p>For this example we have:</p>

<p><script type="math/tex">[\mathcal{F}(A\cos(2\pi\omega t)](\xi)
= \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} A\cos(2\pi\omega t) e^{-i 2\pi\xi t}dt
= A \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{e^{i 2\pi\omega t} + e^{-i 2\pi\omega t}}{2} e^{-i 2\pi\xi t}dt
= \frac{A}{2} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{i 2\pi(\omega - \xi) t} + e^{-i 2\pi(\omega + \xi) t}dt
= \frac{A}{2} (\delta(\omega - \xi) + \delta(\omega + \xi)),</script>
where $\delta$ is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_delta_function">Dirac function</a>.</p>

<p>Interpretation of this result is interesting. Let us treat all $\xi \ge 0$ as frequencies in Hz. If so, $\mathcal{F}(A\cos(2\pi\omega t)$ maps all such frequencies to 0 unless $\xi = \omega$, i.e., unless $\xi$ equals to frequency of original cosine wave. What is more, coefficient $\frac{A}{2}$ is proportional to original amplitude.</p>

<p>Is above result just a coincidence or not? Let us look at the second example: $f(t) = A\sin(2\pi\omega t)$. Calculations look like this:</p>

<script type="math/tex; mode=display">[\mathcal{F}(A\sin(2\pi\omega t)](\xi)
= \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} A\sin(2\pi\omega t) e^{-i 2\pi\xi t}dt
= A \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} \frac{e^{i 2\pi\omega t} - e^{-i 2\pi\omega t}}{2i} e^{-i 2\pi\xi t}dt
= \frac{A}{2i} \int_{-\infty}^{+\infty} e^{i 2\pi(\omega - \xi) t} - e^{-i 2\pi(\omega + \xi) t}dt
= -\frac{Ai}{2} (\delta(\omega - \xi) - \delta(\omega + \xi)).</script>

<p>Again, all $\xi \ge 0$ are mapped to 0 unless $xi$ is equal to frequency of the original sine wave. And, again, coefficient $-\frac{Ai}{2}$ is proportional to original amplitude.</p>

<p>However, now it is imaginary. What does it mean? Actually, this coefficient keeps information about two things: magnitude of amplitude and phase. To see magnitude, one needs to look only at absolute value of this coefficient. Since $\vert-\frac{Ai}{2}\vert = \vert\frac{A}{2}\vert$, both coefficients have the same absolute value. This is in accordance with absence of any differences between sine wave amplitude and cosine wave amplitude. Although two complex numbers $-\frac{Ai}{2}$ and $\frac{A}{2}$ have the same absolute value, their arguments are different. The angle between $-\frac{Ai}{2}$ and $\frac{A}{2}$ is equal to $\frac{\pi}{2}$ radians. This corresponds to phase shift between sine and cosine, and it is in accordance with the fact that $\sin(x + \frac{\pi}{2}) = \cos(x)$.</p>

<p>An interested reader can compute Fourier transform of $f(t) = A\cos(2\pi\omega t + b)$ as an exercise. Phase shift introduced by $b$ should be reflected in argument of complex coefficient before delta functions.</p>

<p>Above examples illustrate a “magic” property of Fourier transform. Fourier transform of a sound function $f$ allows us to decompose $f$ into frequencies and for every frequency find its amplitude and phase.</p>

<p>From mathematical point of view, spectrum of $f$ can be defined as its Fourier transform $\mathcal{F}(f)$. Spectral representation is a representation where frequencies are mapped to their amplitudes and phases.</p>
